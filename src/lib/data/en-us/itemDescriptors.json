If the test is successful, the weapon strikes the target and damage is dealt normally.\n\n[P]Guided requires [AD][AD][AD] to activate, unless otherwise specified in the weapon’s description. Remember, the Guided effect can activate on its subsequent attacks, representing the projectile continuing to track the target.\n\n[P]“Spoofing” is a countermeasure designed to work against the particular projectile—such as flares designed to draw off an infrared missile. Spoofing directly increases the defense of the target against attacks with the Guided quality.",
