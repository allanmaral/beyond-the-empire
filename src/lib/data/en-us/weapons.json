In theory, the 12 Defender is perfect for those who need a bit of personal protection but have no need or desire to carry a larger blaster pistol. In practice, however, this tiny pistol is a cheaply made, largely disposable weapon of questionable reliability. Produced in the millions and possessing no distinguishing markings (not even a serial number) these weapons feature a ceraplas frame coated with a non-reactive polymer case, which makes them incredibly light and nearly invisible to weapon detection systems. They carry only two shots in their integral power pack, and, once fired, cannot be recharged and retain only a small amount of scrap value.\n\nWhile the 12 Defender certainly does offer a fair amount of protection for the price, its shoddy construction and lack of versatility limits its usefulness to the average galactic citizen. However, due to its ease of concealment, ability to elude scanners, untraceable components, and disposable nature, this tiny pistol has found an avid following among the criminal classes.\n\nAdd [SE][SE] to a character's Computers and Perception checks when attempting to find a 12 Defender on a person's body.

    "description": "The DR-45 cavalry blaster by Merr-Sonn is one of a line of convertible blaster carbines marketed to vehicle crews and beast riders. Based on Merr-Sonris popular DD6 blaster pistol, the DR-45, also called the Dragoon, is marketed as an all-in-one weapon providing the portability of a blaster pistol with the range and stopping power of a blaster carbine. To accomplish this, the base weapon, which is a long-barreled blaster pistol, can be fitted with a detachable polycarbonate shoulder stock and a range-extending augmented spin barrel to turn it into a respectably effective blaster carbine. The stock and barrel are fixed to the base weapon with sturdy quick-release mounts that allow an experienced user to mount or dismount the attachments quickly and easily. While not particularly common, Dragoon cavalry blasters are slowly finding a following among members of the Rebel Alliance who value their versatility, reliability, and stopping power.\n\nConverting the DR-45 from a pistol to a carbine takes one maneuver and changes the weapon's combat skill from Ranged (Light) to Ranged (Heavy). Similarly, it takes one maneuver to convert the weapon back, restoring its combat skill to Ranged (Light).",

    "description": "By the last days of the Clone Wars, most war materiel hewed to a handful of standards: blasters locked in drab plasteel chassis, formless body armor removing all soldiers' individuality. Tholoth, having prided itself on its cosmopolitan aesthetic for centuries, struggled with these developments. Their Defense Forces generally used imported materiel. It was more practical and more efficient, but it also carried an air of menace. To the Tholothians, clone troopers carried a sense of being eager to fire on any who stepped out of line.\n\nTholothian Defense Forces solved this tension with the development of their own weaponry. Weaponsmiths incorporated heartwood, a plant native to Tholoth, into unique weapons. These heartwood blasters were as much an aesthetic statement as they were deadly. The wooden chassis harkens back to the Tholoth seedpod practice-a reminder of the community to which the wielder belongs. Like Tholothian society in general, this sentiment reaches across the division of species. Anyone who wields a heartwood blaster can find comfort in remembering their home.\n\nWhen wielding a heartwood blaster, a character may suffer strain up to their Force rating as a maneuver. If they do, they add an equal number of automatic [AD] to the next combat check they make that turn.",

An onboard computer automatically switches to the second power pack once the first is depleted, so that a user reloads half as frequently as with a typical blaster. Because blasters require such infrequent reloading in the first place, this feature proved to be of secondary concern to most buyers, who were put off by the weapon's extra weight in comparison to similarly sized carbines. As a result, the OK-98 sold poorly and SoroSuub discontinued production of the model after only six years. The weapon has since found new life on the black market thanks to an illegal modification that allows it to draw from both packs simultaneously. This does enhance the damage output of the weapon, but also wears out several components in a comparably short time. The modification is fairly sensitive, and a poorly-modified weapon can be quite dangerous to the user.\n\nA character using an OK-98 can ignore the first \"out of ammo\" [DE] result during a combat, just as with an extra power pack, without expending a maneuver.\nA modified OK-98 (requiring an **Easy ([DI]) Mechanics check**) increases weapon damage by 2, replacing the option to ignore the first \"out of ammo\" result.

Lighter and shorter than its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle, the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars. This makes them very attractive to more cash-strapped members of the Rebel Alliance.\n\nDuring combat, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an E5 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).",

    "name": "E-11S Sniper Rifle",
    "description": "Developed from the venerable E-11 blaster rifle, BlasTech's E-11s was designed primarily as a dedicated marksman's rifle for use by the Galactic Empire. A large, sleek, and deadly-looking weapon, the E-11s is nearly as long as a grown human is tall, with a shroud-ed barrel that makes up fully half of its length. Excellent balance and precision-fit components help compensate for this, however, and the E-11 s is quite easy to carry and shoot for a weapon of its size. The E-1Is is incredibly popular among the Empire's scout and reconnaissance forces, whose missions typically see them operating in conditions where the long range and pinpoint accuracy of a dedicated sniper weapon can be used to their fullest potential. In the field, the E-11s grants a small reconnaissance squad incredible reach and allows them to project their force at ranges unmatched by most military units. Officially, the E-11 s carries a restricted rating, limiting it to governmental, military, and law-enforcement use only. That being said, more than a few of these powerful rifles have fallen out of the backs of speeder trucks, so to speak. Those that have found their way into civilian hands make for excellent hunting and sniping weapons, and their performance nearly makes up for the serious risks involved in owning them.\n\nE-11s rifles are equipped with relatively light-weight, matte-finish composite furniture that absorbs light, a fixed stock, and a powerful multioptical telescopic sight. The rifle's firing mechanism uses a supercharged actuating module, upgraded exciter, and extremely volatile, highly compressed blaster gasses to increase the range and penetration of the blaster bolt. This extra power has the added side effect of reducing refraction and beam degradation, allowing it to maintain both its penetration and stopping power at incredible range. While this makes for a powerful weapon, especially in the hands of a talented marksman, it also makes for a weapon that consumes quite a bit of energy and as such has a limited ammunition capacity (a rarity in blasters). These rifles also emit an enormous amount of heat when firing, thanks to their supercharged firing systems. To compensate for this, the E-11 s has a slow rate of fire to allow for cool-down, and the barrel is insulated with a triple-redundant nitrogen cooling system.",

    "description": "Stun rifles are rare weapons in the galaxy, perceived by most to be of limited utility. Possessing low-intensity blast-actuating modulators and using a lower yield mix of blast gasses than other, more lethal blaster rifles, stun rifles are capable of only nonlethal stunning blasts. Most of these weapons are used in law enforcement, corrections, and occasionally in bounty hunting, fields in which the need to keep targets alive is often of paramount importance. They are typically short ranged, and their bolts have a broad spread to catch as many targets in their blast as possible. While this is effective in close quarters or in large crowds, in open terrain their effectiveness is sadly reduced. To counter this, and to corner the market in long-range stun blasters, BlasTech recently released the all-new LBR-9 Stun Rifle.\n\nBased on the current model DL-87 Firespray stun rifle, the LBR-9 is a long-barreled, light-framed blaster rifle fitted with composite furniture and simple iron sights. Using the majority of the Firespray's firing system with an upgraded galven pattern designed to fit the longer barrel, the LBR-9 can fire a concentrated, high-penetration stun bolt with a range and accuracy commensurate with other, more lethal weapons in its class. With its optimized and upgraded galven pattern and a patented mix of blaster gasses, the LBR-9 packs quite a punch and typically needs only one or two shots to knock a target out of commission. Only recently brought to market and largely sold to Core Systems' planetary law-enforcement agencies, few of these specialized weapons have found their way to the fringes of civilized space. Those that do are quickly snatched up by both beast and bounty hunters for their precise handling characteristics and nonlethal nature, and they are gaining a reputation as finely made, accurate, and dependable weapons.",

Just shy of two meters in length, the CR-8 is equipped with a precision barrel, lightweight, matte finish composite furniture, and a highpowered sight. It also features an integrated energy damper that reduces its report and muzzle flash. The weapon's firing system uses a supercharged actuator, upgraded XCiter, and a high-output proprietary blaster gas. These modifications increase power and reduce beam refraction and degradation, allowing the weapon to accurately hit targets at ranges well beyond normal blaster rifle range. The downside is that the weapon produces an inordinate amount of heat, which it must offset with a low rate of fire.\n\nPerhaps the CR-8's most unique aspect is its transportability, the weapon is designed to be broken down into its core components quickly  and easily. with just a few moments of work, the CR-8 can be disassembled into five separate components: berrel, stock, reciever, sight, and energy damper.

Somewhat contrary to its name, the bolt doesn't disable a droid mechanically, but instead attaches to its housing and issues a broadcast command to halt that cannot be refused. The ionization blaster amplifies the command via the blasters power pack to a range of about 12 meters in a wide, unfocused arc.\n\nOrganic life forms feel no more than a brief sting, but droids are blasted with the halt command and simultaneously overloaded with energy that prevents any shielding that might resist it. Most droids are rendered inert for up to half an hour when hit by a successful ionization blast (reflected in the stun damage).\n\nIonization blasters work only on droids and cyborgs, and only deal strain damage as per their Stun quality. They have no effect on organic beings beyond a brief and painful sting. Models Include: Jawa scavenged ion blaster, Merr-Sonn DEMP 2 Ion Carbine.",

Unlike a typical ionization blaster, the droid disruptor fires a targeted stream of coherent ion energy that overloads and burns out droid circuitry and processors. As a result, droids deactivated by a droid disruptor are largely irreparable.\n\nDue to the deadly nature of droid disruptors—at least, to droids—droids tend to view them in the same manner in which organics view disruptor weapons. The weapons are also effective against electronic equipment, though the damage caused to vehicles and vessels is largely negligible unless specifically targeted at a particular vehicular system at point-blank range.\n\nWhen used against organic creatures, the droid disruptor is much less effective. Any organic creature struck by a droid disruptor does not receive normal damage, but instead simply experiences a brief shock to the system and suffers 2 strain.",

A single blast from the T-7 can de-atomize entire groups of lifeforms. During the Siege of Lasan, agents from the Imperial Security Bureau equipped with T-7s slaughtered countless Lasat civilians as a show of Imperial might.

Instead of a chemical propellant, the shard shooter uses a sophisticated electromagnetic propulsion system to accelerate the shards down its barrel at tremendous velocity. The weapon fires in bursts, unleashing a storm of lethal shards at its target, capable of penetrating modern armor and the shredding flesh and bone beneath. Since this weapon is only produced on Selonia, finding the shard ammunition outside of the Corellian System is next to impossible.",

    "description": "Air rifles are not considered weapons on most planets in the galaxy, and the majority of sentients therein see them as little more than toys. Even those Core Worlds with the most draconian restrictions on weapon ownership have no official laws governing air-powered weapons. A specialized form of slugthrower, air rifles use compressed air or other gasses to propel tiny metal pellets or light, spin-stabilized darts over long distances. Lightweight and extremely accurate, they are usually marketed to hobby shooters, collectors, or those who need a quiet, easy-to-use, and relatively safe weapon with which to practice their marksmanship.\n\nThese weapons' balance, accuracy, portability, and the nearly complete silence of their firing mechanism make them excellent weapons for hunters, both of beasts and of sentient beings. Combined with the ability to chamber specialty darts that can be filled with various chemicals and toxins, air weapons make for fine silent killing weapons.\n\nOne of the most common air rifles on the market is the Model 77 from Field Sports, a trusted name in air-weapon production. Known colloquially as the Sandman, thanks to the unique effects of its standard ammunition, the Model 77 is a lightweight, long-barreled air gun similar in silhouette and stature to a sporting blaster. Made primarily of polycarbonate with fibermesh reinforcement, the Model 77 was initially marketed as a nonlethal weapon for animal control and law enforcement. It fires tiny, spin-stabilized darts with laser-honed tips capable of piercing the thickest hide from a detachable clip that is quick and easy to reload. Each dart contains a dose of tranquilizer agent that induces unconsciousness. In addition, the Model 77's darts can be loaded with the heavy-duty \"SmartTranq\" tranquilizer with an active ingredient that adapts itself upon contact with the target's bloodstream to be as effective as possible no matter what the species. Sandman air rifles have a well-deserved reputation for accuracy and reliability. In the Outer Rim many are used by bounty hunters and big-game hunters who need to take prey alive in order to collect their payments.",

    "description": "For millennia, Czerka Arms has maintained a reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles.\n\nA throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients. However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as \"Legacy Arms,\" has proven modestly successful, especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons, whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers.\n\nOne of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip. Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending on the customer's tastes.\n\nNew rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization.\n\nOnce the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a **Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check**).",

To this end, Czerka offers the Detonator Round for use with the Model 38. Instead of the coated penetrator bullet, Detonator Rounds have a metal coated shaped charge bullet that explodes on contact with its target. When used with the Model 38, these rounds have the following effect on the weapon's stats: Remove the Pierce quality and add the Blast (5) quality and Knockdown quality. Detonator Rounds cost 450 credits for a box of rounds, and have a rarity of 7. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, a new box of rounds must be purchased to reload it.",

    "description": "The KS-23 is yet another popular slugthrowing design by Czerka Arms. A rarity even among the already scarce slugthrowing class of weapons, the KS-23 fires a canister of small explosive pellets instead of a single long-range, precision slug. When fired, these pellets scatter from the barrel to fill a wide area with as much destructive potential as possible. Brutally effective at short and medium ranges, this weapon is known unofficially as the \"Hammer.\n\nThe KS-23 was initially produced as a hunting weapon to take down extremely hardy beasts like the krayt dragon or rancor. They are roughly the size of a blaster carbine, with a large-caliber smoothbore barrel, a sturdy action, and composite stocks and furniture. The ammunition is stored in a tubular, five-round magazine that runs under the barrel, and the firing mechanism is self-loading and uses the weapon's recoil for power. An extremely unsubtle weapon, the KS-23 is loud and has a powerful recoil thanks to the large-bore, high-powered ammunition it fires.\n\nThanks to its rugged construction and powerful ammunition, the KS-23 has gained a wide following in the Outer Rim. Easy to maintain and repair and built from high-quality, resilient materials, the Hammer stands up exceedingly well to the kinds of abuse equipment suffers in the wild places of the galaxy. Used primarily by big-game hunters, these weapons have also found their way into the armories of explorers, smugglers, pirates, and even some planetary law-enforcement agencies who appreciate their power and utility.",

Given the weapon’s massive flechette spread and the high number grievous injuries it causes (especially in densely populated locales), collateral damage and unforeseen fatalities are almost guaranteed. Both local and Imperial law enforcement view the mere act of carrying a duo-flechette rifle as a serious crime; they have a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when confronted with one.\n\nWhen activated, the DF-D1 fires twin canisters of needlelike flechettes from its stubby dual barrels. The flechettes lose speed quickly, ensuring the weapon’s range leaves something to be desired. Despite this shortcoming, the flechettes disperse into large clouds capable of affecting several targets at once.\n\nThe DF-D1 is available in both personal and powered armor versions, and it is the primary weapon of the Leviathan series of powered armor. Both versions are identical for all intents and purposes, but the powered armor version is stripped down and incapable of individual use outside the armor’s systems.",

Its effectiveness even prompted Trandoshan mercenaries and other third-party arms manufactureers to create custom rifles fashioned after the Imperial heavy repeater for their own purposes.\n\nAs a maneuver, a character wielding an Imperial heavy repeater may prime the weapon to ecpend all of its emmunition in a single, devastating burst. The next time the weapon is fired this encounter, it counts as having the Blast 7 and Concussive 1 qualities but does not count as having the Auto-fire quality. After being discharged this way, the weapon runs out of ammunition (see page 172 of the **Age of Rebellion** Core Rulebook).",

Taken together, these factors had a large influence on Vurk strategy. They favor long distance engagements, avoiding melee whenever possible. The lone soldier who wades into close range is liable to get gunned down without mercy.\n\nSince heavy industry never took hold on Sembla, Vurk sharpshooters still favor slugthrowers. Most famous is the arquebus, an older design kept current by skilled crafters. In its original form, the weapon was little more than a metal tube filled with explosive powder. Over time, sumptuous wooden stocks to brace against the shoulder became standard. The design became more streamlined and reliable as time went on. Modern versions are works of art unto themselves, often featuring intricate obsidian inlays.\n\nAccurate at extreme distances, the weapon is well suited to patient aiming. A Vurk soldier's most devastating shots are the ones arranged with the most precision. Skeptics have long since explained this away in mundane ways. Longer prep time leads to steadier hands. Calculations of wind resistance are more accurate with more observation. Despite this, Vurk sages insist on a deeper meaning. The best sharpshooters never care about the odds. They trust in the will of the Force, and the Force guides their hands.\n\nAs a maneuver, a character wielding an arquebus may suffer up to 5 strain. The PC's next combat check with the arquebus gains Pierce with a rating equal to the strain suffered.",

Their low-tech construction means they are unlikely to show up on weapons scanners, and stun weapons have sometimes been known to deal lasting damage to a target.\n\nBolas and nets rely on the Ensnare quality of the weapons to incapacitate the user, meaning they require more than simply a successful hit. Due to the great deal of skill required, only those who are very talented or extremely desperate tend to use bolas or nets. Most individuals rely on the stun setting of a blaster to bring their target down.\n\nThe user may spend a [TR] to ensure the victim is so entangled that he may not make any maneuvers, and his only action each turn is a **Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Athletics check** to free himself.",

The latter is particularly important because missile tubes can be fired in one of three modes. The first is infrared, which homes in on a craft's heat signature. The second is gravity-activated mode, which means it tracks a target's repulsorlift. Both of these modes can be spoofed, either by dropping burning flares to distract heat sensors or small repulsorlift pods as chaff. See the Guided weapon quality to handle these two modes of attack.\n\nThe third firing method is direct-fire. This requires more skill but sends the projectile in a straight line that cannot be spoofed by chaff or flares (and loses the Guided quality). Of course, if another target happens to get in the way, or if the attacker's aim is off, the missile will hit whatever is in its path without discrimination. Missile tubes require one preparation maneuver before firing.  \n  \n**Models Include**: Merr-Sonn PLX-2M Missile Tube.",

Among its various product lines are a few devices that don't fall neatly into any one category, possessing both defensive and offensive attributes that make them extremely versatile and effective. One such item is the A014 \"Aranea\" Net Gun.\n\nHeavy and squat, the Aranea is roughly the size of a small blaster carbine with a wide-gauge, rifled barrel, and lightweight polycarbonate furniture. Officially classified as a grenade launcher, the A014 is a single-shot, break-action, breach-loading weapon that fires entangling munitions as opposed to slugs or blaster bolts. The 40mm spin-stabilized ammunition used by the Aranea contains a tightly packed, weighted, finemesh net constructed from synthetic ArachSilk made by CorChemCo. Upon firing, the shells fired by this weapon burst open at a preset range and release the net, the spin of the round causing the net to unfurl and the weights spreading it to its maximum width. With its incredibly strong tensile strength and the ability to tighten around an opponent as he struggles, the Aranea's nets make excellent tools for capturing animal and sentient targets alive.",

Worst of them all was the Candorian Scourge, claiming millions of lives in only 48 hours.\n\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, proper containment had eradicated the disease in the wild. Separatist scientists, inspired by the Scourge, re-engineered captive strains into a terrifying bio-weapon. Schematics recovered by the Jedi claim it to be airborne and almost incurable. While the Empire did its best to bury the plans, dissidents managed to leak them after a raid on the Jedi archives. From an official standpoint, the Rebellion condemns its use. From a practical standpoint, some of the more vicious cells have built them in secret. Luckily for the galaxy in general, nobody has yet managed to replicate the true danger of the blue shadow virus. However, some depraved individuals have managed to retro-engineer a fast-acting variant that dies off quickly but can kill scores of individuals before it vanishes.\n\nWhen a blue shadow grenade detonates, all targets that suffer at least one wound from the grenade-or are within medium range of the detonation while not wearing a rebreather, sealed armor, or other form of environmental protection-must make a **Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check**. Targets suffer 2 wounds and 2 strain per [TH], and a Critical Injury with a + 50 modifier they fail the check. [DE] means that they must make the check again at the start of their next turn as the virus runs rampant through their system.",

While this may fascinate a geologist, it's an idle curiosity to the average citizen.\n\nVurk Rebel cells seeking to liberate Sembla are not the average citizen. Straining under the Empire's yoke, they've been quite keen to weaponize the planet's lava. A handful managed to make a breakthrough, using liberated Imperial research.\n\nThe resulting device is much like a grenade. While difficult to make elsewhere, Vurk Rebels have all they need to build them on Sembla. First, they use Imperial technology to stabilize and contain the magma. Early attempts cooled and congealed too fast, rendering them useless. To work, the devices need a small touch of the Force: Vurk sages skilled in alchemical arts imbue the containment unit with the Force to keep the molten rock from cooling.\n\nA combatant can use the device much the same way as a grenade. On activation, a brief timer starts before the weapon activates. Instead of blasting itself apart, however, the magnet then adheres to a single target. When the timer runs out, the containment unit begins extruding its molten metal payload . The magma then chews through armor plating, scorching any organic tissue it touches.",

    "description": "Thisspiasians once viewed the giant ystervark as both worthy foe and revered delicacy. Xenoarchaeologists even theorize the Blood Monarchy grew from ritual hunts of these creatures. Extinct in modern times, the beast's brutality left a lasting impression on Thisspias. For centuries, engineers sought to emulate its defensive plating and toxic spines.\n\nIn keeping with this motif, ancient warrior-sages created weapons in the beast's image. Their blend of metalwork and the Force even parallels that of modern alchemists. For 250 years, poisoned ystervark spears were the Royal Guard's most iconic weapon. As the Blood Monarchy's public influence fell, so too did the ystervark's. While Thisspiasians still respect both, the call for such weapons has diminished. Before the rise of the Empire, only the Quillbomb retained its mass appeal.\n\nThe device is not much larger than a closed fist, and wicked-looking spines litter its surface. On detonation, these spines rip through armor, burrowing deep into flesh. Each spine carries a dose of synthetic toxin, inspired by the ancient ystervark's venom. With its weak payload, the bomb is less focused on raw explosive power. Rather, it relies on driving at least one spine intact into a victim's body. The contagions used are often as quick as they are debilitating. One spine is enough to immediately impair motor functions. Any more will cause excruciating pain.\n\nWith the Blood Monarchy outlawed by the Empire, the Quillbomb is taking on a new life as a symbol of resistance. Rebels searching for urban weaponry have revitalized the production of these ancient weapons. The bombs are harder to detect than conventional explosives, perfect for saboteurs. Storm troopers are beginning to dread missions to quash Thisspiasian resistance. Once the subject of mockery, the Quillbomb's body count continues to rise. True to form, the bomb has damaged both body and mind of the Imperial war machine. Though nowhere close in size to the ancient ystervark, these bombs would do it proud.",

    "description": "Merr-Sonn's ingenious G-20 Glop Grenade is a reusable, less-than-lethal antipersonnel grenade used to suppress rioters and capture fugitives alive. Roughly the size of a thermal detonator, the G-20 is a small metallic sphere covered in spray nozzles. As a trigger, glop grenades are equipped with a timer that can be set to detonate on contact or set to detonate after a delay of up to fifteen seconds. Inside the sphere is a refillable reservoir that holds a semiliquid foam that instantly hardens upon contact with oxygen. When deployed, the user sets his detonation time and simply throws it at his target. When it detonates, the grenade sprays its quick-hardening foam over a broad area, trapping everything in its range in a thick, nearly unbreakable substance that is almost as strong as ferrocrete. The hardened foam is only good for around five minutes, after which it begins to break down and becomes brittle and easy to shatter.\n\nA glop grenade's Ensnare quality triggers automatically on any targets the weapon hits, with no need to spend [AD].\n\nWhile glop grenades are ostensibly rated as nonlethal, accidents do happen, and they have been known to cause death due to suffocation or, in extremely rare cases, allergic reactions to the foam. Whenever a target is hit with a glop grenade, he must make an **Easy ([DI]) Coordination check** to keep the foam from filling his breathing passages. Failure on the skill check indicates that the foam has cut off the target's air, and he immediately suffers the effects of suffocation as detailed on page 214 of the **Edge of the Empire** Core Rulebook.\n\nGlop grenades that are recovered after use can be refilled with special pressurized hypoinjectors that transfer the foam from a sealed container into the grenade's reservoir without exposing it to the atmosphere. This requires an **Easy ([DI]) Ranged (Light) check** to complete. Failure on the check indicates that the foam has been ruined, and any net [TH] gained on a failed skill check means that some mishap with the filling system occurs and the user is engulfed in quickly hardening goo. This doesn't require an attack roll, but it does require the user to make an **Easy ([DI]) Coordination check** to avoid getting the goo in his nose or mouth per the rules above. Purchase of a Glop Grenade includes the hypoinjector and five refill canisters. Additional refill canisters can be purchased for 100 credits apiece and have a rarity of 6.",

However, baradium can be detonated independently, although these devices are inevitably highly volatile. A large enough baradium charge can level a small town, and incorrectly constructing one can prove to be the brief and fiery end to a demolitionist's career.\n\nBaradium weapons deal damage on planetary scale, but their blast radius is measured in personal scale. If the demolitionist generates [DE] when setting up the device, it detonates immediately, dealing the device's damage (base plus additional damage) to everything in the current blast radius. Anything engaged with the device when it detonates should add +50 to any subsequent critical injury or critical hit rolls.",

It consists of a bulky roil of thick adhesive tape three centimeters wide and fifty meters long wound around a polycarbonate reel. The tape is, essentially, highly processed detonite that will stick to nearly any surface thanks to its built-in adhesive. Like detonite compound, Flex-5 tape requires an electrical charge to detonate and can be set off either remotely or by a timer. Alliance Engineers often use Flex-5 to breach doors and destroy equipment such as computer banks or civilian airspeeders.\n\nA single charge of Flex-5 is a strip roughly a meter long. Since it is extremely simple to use—any trooper who has ever fixed a picture to a barracks wall or to the inside of a footlocker can use the tape—the difficulty of using Flex-5 does not increase past **Easy ([DI])** with additional charges.",

Mounted at the bows of their nagaks (the wide-hulled, oar-powered boats used by the human and Selonian seafarers of Tralus), the styanax lance is a meter-and-a-half long harpoon with a sharp, barbed durasteel tip designed to penetrate the armored scales and tough skin of the styanax. Thrown by the strong arms of the stabmen, the lance is attached to a stout flexisteel cable about two hundred meters long, which the stabmen use to haul in their prey. Rarely seen outside of Tralus, the styanax lance is occasionally used by off-world big game hunters on safari to bring down particularly large beasts, such as giant gundarks or bull rancors.",

    "description": "The wilds of Uvena Prime can be harsh and unforgiving, and have claimed countless Shistavanen hunters. For this reason, Shistavanen survivalists devised an item with every conceivable tool necessary to survive in the wilderness and in battle, dubbed the \"Combat Utility Vibroblade\". Shistavanens say that no respectable surivalist would be caught dead without this handy gadget, though their opinion is often somwhat biased. Still, each C.U.V. is a custom configuration, equipped with eight different tools of the owner's choosing, and as such these devices are extremely useful in the wilds. Containing anything from a fire starter to a hydrospanner to a water contaminant detector, the C.U.V. is many a survivalist's best friend.\n\nThe Combat Utility Vibroblade serves as a tool kit to allow Mechanics checks to repair devices and to \"heal\" droids, but adds [SE] to such checks. Additionally, it adds [BO] to the character's Survival checks.",

Over multiple attacks, he may commit multiple [FO] this way, up to a total number [FO] no greater than his force rating.\n\nAS an action, the wielder may uncommit all [FO] committed to the Sith shield to unleash the stored power in a torrent of hate. When he does so, he gains Conflict equal to the number of [FO] he had committed to the shield and then he makes a Force power check with that many [FO]. He may spend [FP] to inflict 1 wound and 1 strain (these ignore soak) on each other character within short range of him; he may activate this multiple times, inflicting 1 additional wound and 1 additional strain each time.",

Like the Jedi, these sages studied and communed with the Force, though they referred to it as the Ashla.\n\nBefore the Fall of Lasan, many were quick to equate the Ashla Staff to a Jedi's lightsaber. This would not, by and large, be an accurate comparison. An Ashla Staff's construction might reflect on its owner in a similar way, but that would be the full extent of similarities. The staff might be tall and spry, or gnarled and bent. A Revered Master might fashion it from a single branch, once gifted to them by a Tholothian dignitary. What united these tools was their connection to Lasat mysticism. Among other qualities, they gave strength to Revered Masters during particularly grueling rituals.\n\nThese vibrant cultural expressions have become rare under the Empire. The Revered Masters who survived the Fall of Lasan have since passed on or disappeared. Some bequeathed their staffs to their descendants. Others sold them while fleeing the Empire. Many who own these implements now know little of their original purpose. All they know is that a mysterious power seems to flow through them. There is a flicker of destiny in everything the staff touches.\n\nWhile wielding an Ashla Staff and making a Force power check, a player may spend 3 strain to add [LI] to the results.",

    "description": "Like many items made by the Vurk, Semblan daggers tend to serve at least two functions. First, they are utilitarian knives, used as both tools and weapons. Second, the blade's iconic design has served as a meditation aid for centuries of Vurk sages.\n\nIn their most iconic examples, the dagger's blade curves back and forth as it tapers to a point. Vurk sages hold that these gentle undulations mirror the duality of their homeworld. The curving edges hearken to the planet's shallow seas, while obsidian inlays evoke the planet's volcanoes. For centuries, they would mediate on this contrast, searching for harmony. Even if other species lack that cultural context, studying the dagger still has uses.\n\nWhen a Vurk makes a Discipline check at the end of an encounter to heal strain, they heal one additional strain as long as they are holding a Semblan dagger. At the GM's discretion, non-Vurk characters can also benefit from this if they have a thorough grounding in Vurk culture and the mentality to appreciate the meditative properties.",

Though these can vary in shape and coloration, and even certain properties, kyber crystals share certain unique attributes. These attributes allow kyber crystals to be used within lightsabers, enabling them to focus the lightsabers' power into their signature energy blades. Prior to the rise of the Empire, nearly every lightsaber constructed by the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars contained a crystal gathered by a Padawan on the planet Ilum as part of the journey to become a Jedi Knight. These Ilum specimens are some of the best examples of kyber crystals.\n\nThis lightsaber is a basic lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197).

When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes fight multiple foes at once. Although quite dangerous and effective in combat, double-bladed lightsabers are also exceptionally difficult to master. Nevertheless, some Jedi constructed double-bladed lightsabers for themselves, including some notable figures in ancient Jedi myth.\n\nAlthough technically, this weapon contains two lightsaber crystals (one for each blade), for the purposes of gameplay it is treated as having a single crystal.

Some, especially students of the Ataru school, forsook standard-sized lightsabers altogether, instead wielding two shotos. This allowed these individuals to make good use of the acrobatic forms inherent in Ataru to deliver quicker and more accurate blows than an individual wielding a single full-sized lightsaber or even a lightsaber/shoto combination. Perhaps the most famous shoto user was the Jedi Master Yoda, who carried a green-bladed shoto which he used to shocking effect.\n\nThis lightsaber is a basic shoto hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197).

    "description": "The Jedi Temple Guard were the elite defenders of the Jedi Temple in the days of old, tasked with maintaining order and protecting those who resided within. Traditionally, these guardians wielded special double-bladed lightsabers with a long handle and could fight with one or both ends ignited. Though few of the weapons of these legendary protectors survived the fall of the Jedi temple, rumors say that some of these weapons might have survived the destruction of their wielders. The force might well lead one still believes in the ideals of the Jedi Temple Guard to one of their ancient symbols of dedication and honor.\n\nFor the purposes of gameplay, this weapon is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Illum crystal (see page 197 of the Force and Destiny core rulebook). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hardpoints.\n\nWhen purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This represents the fact that the double-bladed saber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end). However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules.\n\nA Temple Guard Lightsaber pike requires two hands to wield.",

    "description": "In the galaxy at large, if Lothal is known at all, it is as an Imperial world home to a Sienar Fleet Systems production line for TIE fighters. Some Imperials also know it as a source of Rebel activity. But for generations of Jedi, the planet was known for its hidden temple, which safeguarded a Force-shrouded source of the kyber crystals utilized in lightsaber construction.\n\nHidden deep within the temple are the remains of the Rodian Jedi Lodaka. An unparalleled master of the third form of lightsaber dueling, Soresu, the Rodian was unusual among Jedi for also spending much of her time mastering a discipline not often thought of in conjunction with the order: physics. Specifically, Lodaka was fascinated by the material properties of the various crystals used in lightsaber construction, and she took a disciplined, reasoned approach to their study. A true scientist, she made careful, controlled experiments with many forms of crystals, both natural and manufactured, concentrating her efforts on modifications in the form of chemical coatings. She theorized that the effects of the different forms of crystals used in lightsabers could be enhanced by manipulating the crystalline structure of the base crystal. Although she used modern grav-field projectors and micromanipulators to conduct her experiments, it is thought she only achieved success when she manipulated the crystals on a molecular level using the Force.\n\nAll of Lodaka’s notes and papers were either destroyed or taken when the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was overrun following the implementation of Order 66. Only one of the crystals she modified is thought to still exist, and it is the one in her own lightsaber, which remains with her body on Lothal. It represented Lodaka’s finest work, as the particular modification she applied at least partially addressed a problem that had vexed lightsaber wielders for thousands of years.\n\nMaster Lodaka’s Lightsaber is a weapon with the following profile: (Lightsaber; Damage 10; Critical 1; Range [Engaged]; Breach 1, Sunder, Vicious 2).\n\nMaster Lodaka’s Lightsaber has an encumbrance of 1 and zero hard points. Attacks made with this lightsaber ignore the Cortosis quality. It also cannot be shut down due to contact with refined cortosis.",

Their G-series beamdrills are used throughout the galaxy in industries as widely varied as computer production and deep-space asteroid mining. They use variable-strength continuous-beam plasma projectors to burn through earth, stone, metals, and nearly any organic or inorganic substance in their path. They can perform any kind of cutting or burning task, from gently melting lightweight polymers to vaporizing waste materials and industrial byproducts. Recently, Karflo Corporation has been exploring smaller, more portable versions of their powerful beamdrills for use by planetary explorers and archaeologists. Their first attempt at this market is the G9-GP Pulse Drill.\n\nThe G9-GP is a handheld, low-powered, precision beamdrill designed for work in excavation and light duty mining. They appear as long, bulky rods with a tank at one end and a variable-angle plasma cutter at the other. The beam emitted by the G9-GP is a rapidly pulsing plasma beam around a millimeter thick with an adjustable range that allows it to cut through relatively thick material. While they are primarily tools, their plasma beams make excellent improvised weapons in an emergency, and more than a few explorers have had their lives or limbs saved from a surprise attack by quick application of the pulse drill.",

    "description": "The Huntsman by LaserHone, a maker of fine vibroweapons based in the Corporate Sector, is a relative oddity among weapons of its class. Over two meters long, the Huntsman is a sturdy vibrospear designed for hunting large and dangerous wild game. Equipped with LaserHone's patented ultrasonic vibrotechnology, the vibrogenerator in the Huntsman vibrates at frequencies well outside the hearing range of most sentients. The ultrasonic vibrogenerator, special dampening fittings, and a coating of sound-absorbing polymers make the Huntsman completely silent when active. This allows a hunter to carry a powerful vibroweapon in the field without the fear of spooking his prey with the noise from the weapon.\n\nThe Huntsman's haft is a super-dense plasteel alloy embedded with sound-deadening materials and laced with foil-fiber reinforcements. Incredibly strong and flexible, the Huntsman can parry nearly any incoming blow, from the claws of a powerful beast to the slashing edge of a vibro-ax. The blade is a long, thin, leaf-shaped affair made from a laser-honed steel alloy with a molecular edge that can pass through steel and stone as easy as through flesh and muscle. At the base of the blade where it meets the haft, two thick posts extend for a few centimeters perpendicular to the haft to prevent particularly recalcitrant beasts from charging up the haft after being stabbed and attacking the spear's wielder. While it is more of a niche weapon with limited appeal, many professional scouts and hunters appreciate the deadly simplicity of the Huntsman and the challenge of hunting untamed beasts in ways similar to their ancient forebears.\n\nThe vibrospear requires two hands to wield.",

    "description": "Creel Wood Logging Corporation is a small, privately owned logging concern founded solely for the harvesting the of the highly sought-after Greel trees from the third and fourth planets of the PH System. Greels are hardy, ancient trees that produce an extremely dense, deep-crimson hardwood. Thanks to the resilience of the trees and the difficulty of harvesting them, GWLC developed special tools to aid in logging and processing. Working closely with a number of precision industrial toolmakers from the Corporate Sector, GWLC produced a line of saws, heavy equipment, specialized heavy-lift speedertrucks, and other assorted logging machinery for their personal use, and eventually they sold them to the general public. Marketed mainly to industrial logging concerns, many of these tools are also used in the surveying and exploration of newly discovered planets, especially those with dense and thorny flora. One of the more common GWLC tools is the Mk. VIII Vibrosaw.\n\nLoud and extremely challenging to use, the Mk. VIII is a heavy vibrosaw that can cut through the toughest undergrowth or fell the tallest trees. They are heavy, awkward brutes that, in the hands of the inexperienced or inattentive, can cause more damage to the user than to the surrounding flora. The Mk. VIII consists of a blocky chassis containing the saw's controls, two SureGrip handles, a power pack, a drive motor, and a vibrofield generator. The blade mounted to the front of the chassis is long and thin, ringed by a rotating, high-speed, diamond-toothed chain whose already impressive cutting ability is further augmented by a powerful vibrofield. Although not designed as such, the Mk. VIII can be used as a weapon in an emergency, its blade slicing through flesh and bone as easily as root and branch. Caution must be used when doing so, however, as even the slightest miscalculation or misstep can result in the user receiving gruesome injuries from his own saw.\n\nIf the user generates [DE] when using the Mk. VIII as a weapon, he hits himself with the attack instead of his target (even if the attack would normally miss). The Mk. VIII requires two hands to use.",

    "description": "The Stalker is Merr-Sonn Munitions' answer to LaserHone's surprisingly popular Huntsman Vibrospear. Like its competitor, the Stalker is a long, sturdy vibrospear nearly as tall as a grown Wookiee, and is designed for hunting large, particularly dangerous wild game. It has a strong, flexible reinforced plasteel haft over two meters long, capped bt a leaf-shaped blade capable of piercing the toughest hide or thickest armor. Beneath the blade are two short barbs that extend for a few centimeters perpendicular from the haft. These barbs are desinged to stop wounded creatures from charging up the weapons haft after they are stabbed, and this attacking the user while in their death throes.\n\nWhile it is lighter and decidedly cheaper than LaserHone's weaponm the Stalker suffers from a few drawbacks. In an effort to keep weight and cost down, Merr-Sonn used the standard model vibrofield generator found in all of their vibro weapons and equipped the Stalker with only the simplest noise-reduction system. This means that while the vibrofield generator's sound output is greatly reduced it makes enough noise to alert most creatures to the user's presence, which makes hunting with the weapon a challenge. Despite this, the Stalker's popularlity continues to grow and it is seen as an affordable alternative to its heavier more expensive competition.\n\nThe Stalker vibrospear requires two hands to use. The GM may spend [TH][TH] from any combat check with this weapon to have it produce a loud noise, spooking nearby animals, alerting foes and adding [SE][SE] to the user's next Survival check in this area to hunt or track prey.",

Field mechanics often carry them into battle for emergency repairs of vehicles, droids, and other equipment. Fusion cutters can be adjusted to produce a fine, precise beam for welds or a broad, powerful beam good for brazing and cutting. Engineering and mechanic droids can have a fusion cutter directly installed in their chassis so that they always have one at hand, and they are especially common on astromech druids. In a pinch, a fusion cutter can be used as a close-quarters weapon, and can cause some incredibly frightful wounds.

Worn strapped to an officer's non-dominant forearm, a riot shield averages around a meter long and nearly as wide, providing almost complete cover for a kneeling or crouching officer. They are constructed from a variety of materials. The shields are typically shaped in such a way as to help deflect incoming thrown objects and stand up to sustained fire from nearly any sidearm, although anything more powerful than a heavy blaster makes short work of a riot shield and the officer behind it. In addition to their obvious protective qualities, riot shields can be used as improvised, somewhat awkward melee weapons, allowing an officer to push and bash his way through a crowd if need be.\n\nRiot shields require one hand to wield, and so can only be used with pistols and one-handed melee weapons. Some riot shields incorporate a slot or mag-lock to allow the user to support a Ranged (Heavy) weapon with the shield itself (firing the weapon one-handed while wielding the riot shield in the other hand).

    "description": "A particularly brutal weapon used to herd thick skinned creatures and, on occasion, sentient beings, the Thunderbolt Shock Prod produced by SoroSuub is a weapon with a mixed reputation throughout the galaxy. At once the symbol of bucolic agricultural life and brutally oppressive regimes, the Thunderbolt consists of a solid alloy staff nearly two meters long. At one end is a heavily insulated, two-handed grip and at the other is a series of sharp prongs. The prongs aren't the main threat posed by these weapons, however. Rather, it is the powerful electrical shock generated by them. Able to produce an electrical arc powerful enough to tame a krayt dragon, the Thunderbolt is popular among planetary security forces and slavers, and judicious use of these weapons by riot police can disperse a violent crowd in minutes. The effects of the noise and the crippling pain from the shock quickly incapacitate even the most determined rioters, and these weapons are infamous throughout the galaxy.",

They use ion turbine generators to create masses of negatively charged particles which are fused with plasma and released as blasts or pulses. The negatively charged particles interfere with a target's electrical systems, shorting circuits, corrupting computers, and forcing system shutdowns in an effort to subdue a target or make it easier to destroy via more traditional means. Although designed to do little-to-no physical damage to targets, collateral damage such as fried circuits, fused joints, and even fires may occur due to the intense energy surges.",

Atgar’s most\nnotable contribution to military hardware, the 1.4 FD\nP-Tower anti-vehicle laser cannon, was designed to\ndefend ground outposts from the advance of enemy\nrepulsorcraft, light armor, and mechanized infantry.\nIts incredible range and ability to operate effectively\nin nearly any environment ensured its widespread use\nfor years, but the P-Tower’s lackluster onboard targeting computer, inability to penetrate heavier armor,\nand limited protection for its operator saw it replaced\nby more capable models.\n\nWhile organizations such as the Rebel Alliance have\nkept the P-Tower in service, Atgar SpaceDefense has\nsought to breathe new life into unsold inventory by reusing some of the parts from the P-Tower in a new antiinfantry weapon: the 1.8 FD Anti-Infantry Autoturret.\n\nOstensibly a new product, the 1.8 FD recycles a\ngreat deal of hardware from the P-Tower, but serves a\nvery different battlefield function. While it can be used\nto engage light vehicles, its true purpose is suppressing enemy infantry without putting one’s own troops at\nrisk. Thanks to its innate ability to be connected to an\nAtgar artillery remote, it lets a small group of defenders effectively engage much larger numbers of foes\nwithout leaving the safety of cover. Though extremely\nweighty, this emplacement is considerably lighter than\na P-Tower, allowing squads of infantry to reposition it\nin the field with the help of a light speeder or loader\ndroid. However, this comes at the cost of ammunition\ncapacity, and so the 1.8 FD can only fire a few salvos\nbefore depleting its energy reserves.\n\nWhile attached to a suitable power source (such as\na base’s power grid or a similarly-sized generator), this\nweapon loses the Limited Ammo 8 quality.

A large, intimidating weapon, the BR-219 has a short, thick barrel with a broad aperture, a heavy-duty frame, and a custom grip with an integral recoil compensation system. These super-heavy pistols were developed in response to requests from bounty hunters and law enforcement agencies for a powerful, pistol-sized weapon for use in taking down particularly dangerous opponents. To meet the demand, BlasTech turned to one of its most popular and well-respected product lines and developed the BR-219 from its E-11 series of millitary blaster rifles.\n\nUsing the E-11's reciever and firing mechanism, BlasTech engineers then reengineered the XCiter and actuating module to produce an overcharged bolt, equipped the drastically shortened barrel with an improved Galven pattern, and developed a special and highly volatile blend of blaster gases to feed their new weapon. All of this enhanced technology combined with the new bespoke blaster gas made for an extremely powerful—if slightly inaccurate and finicky—pistol. The bolt from the BR-219 is nearly as powerful as the E-11, and the weapon produces a tremendous noise and muzzle flash when fired. It is neither a subtle nor a restrained weapon; openly carrying one of these massive pistols makes an eloquent point about the user's intentions.\n\nThe BR-219 is not sold through BlasTech's usual dealer network. Instead, the weapon must be custom ordered straight from the factory. A thorough Imperial Security Bureau background check and a specially issued carry permit are required to purchase one of these weapons legally. Of course, this background check can be circumvented by purchasing the pistol on the black market or acuiring it through other less-than-legal means. Carrying a BR-219 without the proper permit is a risky business, and being found with an illegally purchased model is grounds for immediate Imperial imprisonment. Using a BR-219 in combat for an extended period of time is,  to the least, quite hazardous. The immense heat generated by the high-performance blaster gas and the overcharged action of the firing mechanism put an incredible amount of strain on the weapon.\n\nGMs may spend [TH][TH] from a check to cause the BR-219 to become damaged one step (undamaged to minot, minor to moderate, etc.) and suffer the penalties listed on page 166 of the **Force and Destiny** Core Rulebook until repaired. In addition, Game Masters may spend [DE] to cause the BR-219 to melt down and explode, destroying the weapon and dealing the weapon's base damage to the user.",

    "description": "Introduced during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, SoroSuub's GLX Firelance is one of the company's most popular models of blaster rifle. The product of a long and extensive spate of market research among professional soldiers, the weapon was developed to provide a simple, reliable, high performance blaster with most of the power of a sull-sized blaster rifle in a package the weight and size of a carbine. The GLX was an immediate success, especially among bounty hunters and mercenaries. It was so popular, in fact that SoroSuub marketed the GLX as \"the most effective weapon available for freelance law enforcement agents\". Orders poured in from all across the galaxy, and  the rifle soon became one of SoroSuub's best-selling products.\n\nThe rifle itself is a tradtionally-styled, compact weapon closer in size and weight to a blaster carbine than as a full-sized blaster rifle. It has a short barrel with an integral flash hide, a top-mounted carrying handle that extends the length of the reciever, allowing easier carrying by those with larger hands or in bulky armor, and a solid stock with built-in recoil compensators. The GLX features a select-fire system that allows the weapon to operate in single-shot or automatic mode, and its stun setting is the most powerful in its class—able to render even the toughest opponents or most dangerous creatures insensible.",

It is an elegant, well built blaster rifle featuring a precision barrel, lightweight skeleton stock, and minimal foilfiber reinforced polycarbonate furniture. The weapon's firing mechanism is a slightly detuned version of Merr-Sonn's military-grade blaster system giving the rifle pinpoint accuracy and an incredible punch at extreme range. The LD-1 is also equipped with a Mk. 19 computer-aided macroscope with various optical enchancements and an Autosteady gyro-gimbal system to increase the weapon's performance at long and extreme ranges. It is easily disassembled and is sold with a custom-fit carrying case for transporting the rifle around in a relatively discreet fashion.\n\nSince its introduction, the LD-1 has become wildly popular. Its performance, power, and build quality are nearly unmatched in its segment. These qualities—combined with its official classification as a sporting blaster, which allows it to circumvent most weapon restrictions in the galaxy—have driven the LD-1 to consistently outsell the older SoroSuub X-45. In addition, aggressive marketing by Merr-Sonn and regular appearances on a popular HoloNet adventure drama proggram have established the LD-1 firmly in both military and popular culture.\n\nIt is rumored that a variant called the LD-1a is produced in small numbers for the Imperial Security Bureau. The truth of these rumors has yet to be verified, but if there is a special ISB version of the LD-1, it would sell for a Moff's ransom on the black market should one ever appear there.",

Built to exacting specifications by SoroSuub, Paladin rifles are as much works of art as they are weapons. With their highly polished black barrels and frames, pearlescent silver polycarbonate furniture, and ornate fittings, they are striking weapons that make quite an impression on those who see them.\n\nDespite their officially ceremonial nature, these weapons are incredibly potent in combat. Respectable range and accuracy, and the ability to switch between single-shot, and auto-fire make Paladin rifles very dangerous in the right hands. From the factory, they are fitted with slings, collapsible stocks, and a number of other features designed to optimize their combat efficientcy while maintaining their ceremonial look. In addition, when  assigned to Senate Guardsmen, these weapons were fitted with an under barrel stun prod that combined with their stun setting, made them suitable for crowd control duties as well as combat.\n\nToday, Paladin rifles are a rare sight and most remain in storage armories deep below the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. Some have made their way to the galactic weapons market, however, commanding steep prices whenever they are sold.\n\nThe damage from the Superior quality is included in the weapon's profile. When the integral stun prod is used in clos combat, it has the following profile: Melee Damage +2; Critical 6; Range (Engaged); Disorient 2; Stun Damage.",

I Saberdart. The Saberdart, a name that applies to both the dart itself and its launcher, is a tiny, roughly triangualr durasteel alloy dart fired via compressed air. The dart has three hooked barbs surrouding a central cylinder tipped withy an incredibly sharp needle. Within the central core of the dart is a small, fillable chamber used to deliver toxins and poisons to targets at range. Saberdarts can be used to deliver anything tranquillizers to deadly neurotoxins such as Fex-M3 and Malkite themfar. They are silent, deadly, obscure and largely untraceable, which makes them a perfect weapon for assassins.\n\nSaberdart launchers have lightweight barrels that propel their darts via compressed gas. Dart launchers can be built into gloves, pieces of armor, other weapons, even innocuous pieces of everyday gear like datapads and glowrods.\n\nSaberdarts may be loaded with 1 dose of synthetic neuroparalytic (see page 181 of the **Force and Destiny** Core Rulebook), or any other poison the GM, deems appropriate.

They are compact, small-framed, slug-throwing pistols that utilize a powerful, miniatureized mass driver to fire sharpened ferroceramic darts at very high velocities. The first needlers were introduced by Golan Arms during the height of the Galactic Republic. Nearly silent in their operation, and remarkably hard to detect when concealed, they were heavily marketed to individuals and government operatives who needed a reliable, easily concealed, difficult to trace weapon. Along with their silent operation and ease of use, one of these weapons' biggest selling points is their ammunition. Darts fired from a needler bypass personal energy shields with ease, and they can be coated in a variety of lethal and non-lethal toxins to subdue or kill targets. This has mde them very attractive to bounty hunters, spies and, and assassins, who appreciated their versatility and deadly utility.\n\nThe NX-14 is one of Golan Arms' latest forays into needler technology. Its smallest, most compact offering to date, this weapon is slightly smaller than a grown human's hand and roughly as thick as a common datapad. It is constructed of an inert, light-absorbing fibermesh polycarbonate with shielded internals, making an already difficult to detect weapon nearly impossible to find when concealed properly. The weapon's standard ammunition is a solid, spin-stabilized, razor-sharp ferroceremic dart that can punch through nearly any personal armor or shield with ease.\n\nA needler removes all [SE] added by personal deflector shield.

One of the first weapons the company produced was the \"Precision-X\" series, now highly coveted weapons sought by everyone from sport shooters to assassins. The company can hardly maintain a stock of these specialized rifles, so high is the demand for their unique capabilities.\n\nThe Precision-X blasters use a series of multiple cycling chambers to excite the blaster gas used so that it produces extraordinarily intense beams. The blasters' shots are only somewhat more powerful than those of typical carbines, but the blasts maintain an extraordinary coherence over long ranges, allowing them to punch through light armor and maintain full stopping power well past the limitations of a typical rifle. The effects of these cycling chambers even extend to the blaster's stun setting, making it ideal for bounty hunters trying to bring in a target alive.\n\nWhen this weapon's stun setting is used to deal stun damage, its range changes to medium instead of short (and cannot be increased).",

Lacking the destructive potential of proton torpedoes while inflicting more substantial physical damage than other ion weapons, the ion torpedo might provide the perfect solution for a captain who wishes to end a battle quickly but still take the enemy vessel (mostly) intact.\n\nAn ion torpedo is designed to release a powerful energy pulse only after puncturing a ship's hull. Consequently, powerful deflector shields or thick armor can greatly mitigate the weapon's effectiveness. Still, a well-placed ion torpedo can hamstring nearly any ship, ensuring that this specialized ordnance sees continued use by the Alliance, particularly on sensitive missions to disable or capture experimental Imperial vessels.\n\nAdditional ion torpedoes cost 400 credits for a set of four.",

When they strike a target, proton rifles' beams deliver a powerful kinetic blast that knocks lighter targets off their feet and can stagger even the toughest, meanest prey.\n\nMerr-Sonn's MR-90 is one of the best proton rifles on the market. Marketed toward wealthy, image-conscious big-game hunters, these handsome rifles are equipped with numerous shooting aids to improve their overall performance. They feature an integrated gyroscopic balancing system that assists in balance and handling, a multi-optic telescopic sighl that allows a shooter to target prey in nearly all conditions, and a charge setting that trades the weapon's ammunition capacity for a single, devastating blast. Despite the fact that the MR-90 is marketed as an upscale hunting rifle for aristocratic adventurers, many military and paramilitary forces throughout the galaxy have adopted it as a dedicated anti-materiel weapon and high-powered sniper rifle.\n\nAs a maneuver, a character using an MR-90 can set the weapon to its charge setting, which allows the shooter to expend all of the rifle's energy in a single, devastating blast. Once charged, the MR-90 counts as having the Breach 1 and Concussive 2 item qualities. After the charged beam is fired, the weapon runs out of ammunition.",

Roughly the size and weight of a standard holdout blaster, the CS14 is built using lightweight polycarbonates and sensor-proof alloys.

While Xerrol claims that the invisible bolt setting was designed for night hunting and stalking light-sensitive beasts, the fact that it allows a shooter to remain completely undetected while firing has not been overlooked by the galaxy's assassins and intelligence agents. The power requirements for firing the rifle in stealth mode are quite onerous, however, and its rate of fire becomes significantly reduced from the depletion of its power cells.\n\nSwitching the Nightstinger to stealth mode requires a maneuver.

The weapon's spread can be adjusted so that it fires all of its discs in a single line or in a broad arc that can catch multiple targets. Entirely silent and easily concealable, the Mk-127 is often used for jobs in which silence and stealth are paramount.\n\nChanging the weapon's spread from single to arc requires a maneuver and grants the weapon the Blast 6 item quality. If Blast is activated, the weapon's supply of discs is exhausted in the shot. When worn on both wrists, Mk-127s can be fired as if they were a single weapon with a regular combat check, gaining the Linked 2 quality. Noticing that an individual is wearing one or a pair of these weapons requires a **Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Perception check**. At the Game Master's discretion, the discs can be coated with various toxins. Reloads for the Mk-127 contain four discs and cost 100 credits.",

    "description": "Initially designed by the Vacutech Combine—which ran out of capital and declared bankruptcy during the development of this weapon thanks to Imperial meddling—the Vac Attack is a small projectile launcher worn around the wrist like a chrono. It fires bursts of small, extremely sharp discs that can shred armor and flesh like a flechette. The weapon's spread can be adjusted so that it fires all of its discs in a single line or in a broad arc that can catch multiple targets. Entirely silent and easily concealable, the Mk-127 is often used for jobs in which silence and stealth are paramount.\n\nChanging the weapon's spread from single to arc requires a maneuver and grants the weapon the Blast 6 item quality. If Blast is activated, the weapon's supply of discs is exhausted in the shot. When worn on both wrists, Mk-127s can be fired as if they were a single weapon with a regular combat check, gaining the Linked 2 quality. Noticing that an individual is wearing one or a pair of these weapons requires a **Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Perception check**. At the Game Master's discretion, the discs can be coated with various toxins. Reloads for the Mk-127 contain four discs and cost 100 credits.",

Good for only one shot, the blaster mechanism focuses all of its power into a single, high-powered blast that can penetrate most armor and can incapacitate or even kill the toughest opponent in the blink of an eye. Despite their utility, wrist blasters have a number of downsides. They are illegal on most worlds, although that doesn't stop individuals from using them. In addition, their range is pitifully short: users must be almost touching their target for the weapon to have any effect. Finally, since wrist blasters are only good for one shot, a user is put in a precarious situation if the blast fails to incapacitate or kill the intended target.\n\nNoticing that an individual is wearing a wrist blaster requires a **Daunting ([DI][DI][DI]) Perception check**.

    "description": "One of the more popular pistols on the market, Merr-Sonn's PB08 was designed as a direct competitor to BlasTech's DL-44. Simple and reliable, the PB08 is a sturdy, large framed blaster pistol with a short ventilated barrel that delivers excellent damage and penetration over short ranges. What makes the PB08 stand out from the crowd is its heat management and energy conservation systems. Most heavy blaster pistols, especially the DL-44, have a nasty tendency to overheat or run out of blaster gas at the most inopportune times. Merr-Sonn's designers eliminated these drawbacks from the PB08 by using gas circulation heat sinks in the barrel to dissipate the heat generated by the powerful blaster bolts. These pistols also have a unique energy management system designed to squeeze as much energy out of Tibanna gas as possible. While this makes the PB08 more reliable, it also reduces the weapon's range and raw damage output.\n\nThis weapon cannot be made to run out of ammo by spending [DE].",

Utilizing the unique energy-focusing qualities of refined kyber crystals and powered by four huge animatter generators, this weapon has the ability to completely destroy planets with a single blast.\n\nThe superlaser has no damage or critical rating, yet deals damage. Its destructive power is on such a level that it transcends mere numbers. When the Death Star fires its superlaser, everything in its path is utterly destroyed. Even when using the energy from a single reactor, it can crater cities and devastate huge swaths of a planet's surface.\n\nThe damage that this massive weapon can dish out is more narrative that mechanical. If the players ever encounter the Death Star and see the superlaser in action, the Game Master should describe ships burning to ash as it they were paper, whole worlds obliterated in the blink of an eye, shockwaves and strange localized hyperspace anomalies, and other terrible consequences. Force-sensitives, for example, might become disoriented from the death cries of an entire city's population. If the Player Characters are ever targeted by the Death Star's superlaser, the Game Master should find a way to allow them to escape what would be certain death, perhaps by making suitably heroic Piloting (Space) checks or spending Destiny Points.",

Properly placed charges are capable of incapacitating armored vehicles or blasting major breaches in a fortification.\n\nSetting up one or more Destro-6 charges with the safeties fully engaged requires an **Easy ([DI]) Mechanics check** and takes five minutes per charge. Disabling the safeties for a batch of charges halves the time required, but increases the difficulty of the check to **Hard ([DI][DI][DI]).** The GM may spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] on any Mechanics check using charges with disabled safety features to cause a premature detonation.\n\nWhen a charge detonates, it deals 20 damage with the Breach 1 quality to every character and vehicle within short range.
